# 🏆 Autonomous Driving Android Car 💻 📱 🚗 📷 #
Autonomous Driving Car for android smartphones developed by [B. Grau](https://github.com/SuperCrazyKing) and [D. Lagamtzis](https://github.com/umadbro96) (since 2018).

Autonomous Driving Car is an android based application which enables an modell car to drive through a test track.
This project was done to find out if todays smartphones are able to accomplish such a task and if yes, how good this is possible. Also this project was chosen to get to know the OpenCV Framework.

If successful in the use of OpenCV with Android, the core functionality will be merged in the [Smartphone Sensing Framework](https://github.com/MrDio/Smartphone-Sensing-Framework), a Framework to disrupt the IoT

## Introduction ##
The application is developed in the Android Studio Developement Kit. Currently all Modul are implented within that IDE.
All Modules and Dependencies can be found at: 

The following dependencies are used:
1. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/platforms/android/): OpenCV for Android provides the well known and powerful framework for picture manipulation that enables machine vision. 
2. [Arduino-Android-Library](https://github.com/OmarAflak/Arduino-Library/): This provides the analog communication between Android and Arduino
3. [Arduino 1.8.7](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software): This is provides the ability to flash arduino and to modify the code needed for the Android App.
4. `Arduino-Code Model Car`: If you need a look into the Arduino Code, do not hasitate to contact us.
